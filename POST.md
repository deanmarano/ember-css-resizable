This is an example of using a css resizable element with localstorage persistent.

Starting off with a new ember app:

```
ember new ember-css-resizable --embrodier=true
```

Which, after creating files and installing packages, instructs me how to get
the server started:

```
🎉  Successfully created project ember-css-resizable.
👉   Get started by typing:

  $ cd ember-css-resizable
  $ npm start
```
